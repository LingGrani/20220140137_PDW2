        <h2>Divine Goddess</h2>
        <p>Lunox was born with magical powers, and her dreamworld reflects and changes the real world. With this power, she uses her dreamworld to temporarily maintain the balance of energy between order and chaos. But as the power of order and the power of chaos rushed into her dreams, Lunox fell into a long sleep and turned into one of the "Twilight Orbs."</p>
